# FPL AI Engine

Decision-support software for Fantasy Premier League squad construction and transfer planning. The engine converts official FPL player, team, fixture, and manager data into multi-gameweek expected-points projections, then solves a constrained optimisation problem for the highest-value squad trajectory available under FPL rules.

The project is designed around a practical question: **which squad and transfer sequence best balances expected points, budget, free transfers, transfer penalties, fixture difficulty, and future optionality?** It provides both an interactive Streamlit control room and a single-command command-line report.

## Capabilities

- Refreshes active player, team, fixture, and manager-state data from the official FPL API.
- Normalises the API payload into analysis-ready player and fixture datasets.
- Produces gameweek-level expected-points projections using player performance, minutes, availability, price, and fixture difficulty signals.
- Builds a season-level chip roadmap from fixture congestion, double gameweeks, blank gameweeks, and fixture difficulty.
- Solves a four-gameweek mixed-integer model-predictive-control (MPC) problem for squad state, line-up selection, transfers, free-transfer rollovers, bank balance, and hit costs.
- Ranks the resulting starting XI, captain, vice-captain, and bench for the next gameweek.
- Exposes the result through a Streamlit dashboard and an executive CLI summary.

### Core modules

| Layer | Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Presentation | `app.py` | Interactive controls, pipeline execution, squad visualisation, transfer actions, chip roadmap, and analytics table. |
| Orchestration | `main.py` | Reproducible end-to-end command-line execution and reporting. |
| Acquisition | `src/fetch_data.py`, `src/fetch_fixtures.py` | Retrieve official player, team, and fixture data and persist raw exports. |
| Data processing | `src/process_data.py` | Validate, filter, normalise, and enrich player records with positions and team names. |
| Projection | `src/train_model.py` | Generate deterministic gameweek expected-points projections from player signals and fixture difficulty. |
| Season planning | `src/season_planner.py` | Identify fixture anomalies and congestion patterns and select candidate chip gameweeks. |
| Optimisation | `src/multi_week_optimizer_mpc.py` | Formulate and solve the sequential squad and transfer MILP with PuLP/CBC. |

The optimiser models the squad as a state carried from one gameweek to the next. Its objective combines discounted expected points with liquidity value and transfer-friction penalties. Constraints cover the 15-player squad structure, legal formations, three-player club limits, budget, free-transfer rollovers, and paid transfer hits.

## Technology Stack

- Python 3.10+ (type syntax and standard-library `pathlib` usage assume a modern Python runtime)
- Streamlit for the interactive application
- pandas and NumPy for tabular data processing and projection calculations
- PuLP with the CBC mixed-integer solver for constrained optimisation
- Requests for official FPL API integration
- CSV and JSON artifacts for transparent, inspectable pipeline state

```

## Local Setup

Create an isolated environment and install the runtime dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install numpy pandas requests pulp streamlit
```

Run the command-line pipeline:

```bash
python main.py
```

Launch the interactive dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The pipeline requires network access to the official FPL API and writes refreshed snapshots into `data/`. The CLI uses the currently persisted manager state when available. In the dashboard, enable scratch mode to construct a new £100.0m squad, or enter an FPL team ID to load a manager's current squad before optimisation.

## Data Flow

1. `fetch_data.py` stores raw players, teams, and the detected gameweek.
2. `process_data.py` filters unavailable records and normalises costs, positions, teams, and availability.
3. `fetch_fixtures.py` stores upcoming fixtures and difficulty ratings.
4. `season_planner.py` derives a chip roadmap and writes `macro_plan.json`.
5. `train_model.py` writes `ai_players_multiweek.csv` with projections for gameweeks 1-38.
6. `multi_week_optimizer_mpc.py` validates the inputs and solves the rolling four-gameweek plan.

The committed files in `data/` are inspectable snapshots, not a substitute for refreshing the official API before making a current decision.

## Engineering Notes

- The projection layer is a transparent, deterministic scoring model rather than a black-box training service. This keeps feature influence and failure modes inspectable.
- The optimisation output is a recommendation, not an automated trade execution mechanism. Transfers must be applied on the official FPL platform.
- API availability, fixture rescheduling, late team news, and player minutes uncertainty can materially change results. Re-run the acquisition and projection stages before each decision.
